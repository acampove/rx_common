# $R_X$ common

The purpose of this project is to:

- Offer a thin layer of python code meant to interface and test the $R_x$ run3
[gitlab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/LHCb-RD/cal-rx-run3) tools, written in C++ and adapted from the Run1/2 code.

- Store new tools, needed for the Run3 analyses, that can be shared among Run3 $R_X$ analyses.
